# hebrew-learning-app
Hebrew learning app that concentrates on Hebrew roots.
# Hebrew Roots Master 🔤

*Learn Hebrew the way it was meant to be learned - through roots, patterns, and a healthy dose of neurosis*

## What is this?

A Hebrew learning app that focuses on **root-based learning** instead of random vocabulary memorization. Unlike Duolingo and other apps that treat Hebrew like any other language, this app teaches you the beautiful internal logic of Hebrew through its 3-letter root system.

## Why roots matter

Hebrew isn't just a collection of random words - it's built on patterns! Once you understand that כ-ת-ב (write) creates words like כתב (he wrote), כותב (writer), מכתב (letter), and כתיבה (writing), you're not just memorizing - you're understanding.

## Features

- 🌳 **Word family trees** - See how one root creates dozens of related words
- 🎭 **Neurotic tutor** - Learn with a self-deprecating guide who's just as confused as you are
- 📜 **Torah connections** - Bridge modern Hebrew with biblical text
- 🧠 **Pattern recognition** - Learn the binyan system visually
- 📚 **Etymology stories** - Understand why Hebrew works the way it does
- 🎯 **Smart practice** - Quizzes that focus on roots, not random vocab

## Perfect for

- Hebrew learners frustrated with surface-level apps
- Students preparing to read Torah or other Hebrew texts
- Anyone curious about how Hebrew actually works
- People who appreciate a little Jewish humor with their learning

## Current Status

This is a **prototype** built with Streamlit. Currently includes 4 sample roots (כ-ת-ב, א-כ-ל, ל-מ-ד, ש-מ-ע) to demonstrate the concept.

## Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hebrew-roots-app.git

```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` and start learning!

## Roadmap

- [ ] Expand to 200 high-frequency roots
- [ ] Add audio pronunciation
- [ ] Interactive binyan pattern visualizations
- [ ] Spaced repetition system
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Community features for practice partners

## Why I built this

As someone studying Hebrew and Torah, I was frustrated that existing apps don't capture Hebrew's unique structure. Hebrew isn't just another European language - it has its own logic that, once understood, makes everything click. Plus, learning should be fun, and what's more fun than a neurotic tutor who's been studying Hebrew for 30 years and is still confused?
